TABLE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT: |
  Extract and return all visible text content from the table in the image as plain text.
  Include:
  - All data, whether it appears in header cells, row cells, column labels, or footnotes
  - All numbers, labels, symbols, units, and punctuation exactly as they appear
  - Any merged cell content must be repeated in every affected row and column

  Each line must be a complete, self-contained fact or data line.  
  For example:  
  "For Hyderabad city, temperature is 25 Celsius."  

  Format each row's information on a separate line starting with "ROW:" followed by the complete description of that row's data.
  For example:
  "ROW: For Hyderabad city, temperature is 25 Celsius and humidity is 60 percent."
  "ROW: For Mumbai city, temperature is 30 Celsius and humidity is 75 percent."
  Treat every **visually aligned horizontal row** as a single logical data row, regardless of how many vertical columns or dividing lines it contains. **Do not split one visual row into multiple ROW lines, even if it includes many vertical sections.**
