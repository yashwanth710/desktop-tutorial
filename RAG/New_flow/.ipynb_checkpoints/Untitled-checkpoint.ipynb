The cleaned defects shall be touched-up with the base layers of the specified coating system. Thereafter a full coat of the initial top layer(s) shall be applied. Refurbishment shall be considered if the whole coated area shows more rusting than described under spot repair. Refurbishment shall not be selected if the rusting pattern is of the pinpointed type. Any degree of pinpoint rusting shall require renovation; see below.  \n",

      "After the complete initially coated surfaces have been pre-cleaned, all surfaces shall be blast cleaned. Carbon steel and low-alloy steels shall be blasted to the visual standard SSPC-SP 10 / NACE No. 2 at the time of coating. After the surface preparation, a completely new coating system shall be applied. Renovation shall be considered if the rusting pattern as described in ISO-4628-3 is pin-pointed over the whole coated area or if the rust grades are higher than those described under refurbishment.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 17.7 Stainless Steels  \n",
      "Where coating maintenance to stainless steel surfaces is required, the entire surface shall be thoroughly sweep blasted to remove flaking and poorly adherent paint and to provide a surface roughness to any well-adhered paint surfaces. This shall then be followed by the appropriate, compatible maintenance painting system.  \n",

      "\n",
      "This section describes the minimum requirements for the internal coating of line pipe for non-corrosive sales gas transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application of Internal flow coating systems promotes two primary functions:  \n",
      "\n",
      "a. Reduced gas friction by provision of a very smooth surface profile.  \n",
      "b. The inhibiting of Black Powder formation within the gas pipeline.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The term \"Black Powder\" is a colour descriptive term used to describe a blackish material (very small, jagged and very hard particles) that can develop within the gas pipelines due to a reaction of Fe with condensed moisture, containing O₂, H₂S and CO₂ which leads to erosion failures and damage to pipeline operational valves, lowers efficiency of compressors and clogs instruments. This is a world-wide problem that affects most gas pipeline operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coating may also offer short-term corrosion protection during transport and storage, however additional preservation measures may still be required.\n",
      "\n",
      "It specifies the requirements for coating materials, coating application, inspection and testing and gives procedures for the qualification of coating materials and SUB-CONTRACTORs.\n",
      "\n",
      "General coating qualification is performed for the purpose of an overall qualification of coating system and SUB-CONTRACTOR but is not necessarily related to a specific project.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this process, a list of qualified coating systems and SUB-CONTRACTORs is developed, from which the COMPANY may select a coating system and SUB-CONTRACTOR for a specific project. It saves time and avoids re-qualification for similar projects. The general qualification is given independent of line pipe diameter and wall thickness. When required for specific projects, additional testing should be performed on different line pipe diameters and wall thicknesses.\n",

For example, the basic identification colour for all oils is brown, but it may be necessary to differentiate between the live crude, stabilized crude, lubrication oil, seal oil etc. In this case the same principles apply, in that the base identification colour will identify the prime nature of the pipe contents and supplementary banding will provide further identification.\n",

      "This section describes the minimum requirements for the internal coating of line pipe for non-corrosive sales gas transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application of Internal flow coating systems promotes two primary functions:  \n",
      "\n",
      "a. Reduced gas friction by provision of a very smooth surface profile.  \n",
      "b. The inhibiting of Black Powder formation within the gas pipeline.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The term \"Black Powder\" is a colour descriptive term used to describe a blackish material (very small, jagged and very hard particles) that can develop within the gas pipelines due to a reaction of Fe with condensed moisture, containing O₂, H₂S and CO₂ which leads to erosion failures and damage to pipeline operational valves, lowers efficiency of compressors and clogs instruments. This is a world-wide problem that affects most gas pipeline operators.' metadata={'page': 75, 'source': 'D:/rag_poc/rag_pdfs/proposals/internal\\\\8.AGES-SP-07-004-Painting and Coating Specification.pdf', 'type': 'full', 'chunk_number': 361, 'doc_id': 'cf150659d59110e8730082b4c634aeb6_360'}\n",
